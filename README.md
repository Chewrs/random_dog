# flask random dog picture


This little website will show you a random dog picture every time you reload it.
## Usage
You can try the website on [this link](https://chewrs.pythonanywhere.com/dog).

You can try to make your own by follow the step below.
1. clone this repository 
```
git clone https://github.com/Chewrs/random_dog.git
```
2. install all the library
```
 pip -r requirements.txt
 or
 pip3 -r requirements.txt
```
3. you can adjust the API and Flask in [flask_app.py](https://github.com/Chewrs/random_dog/blob/main/flask_app.py), and the html in [/templates/index.html](https://github.com/Chewrs/random_dog/blob/main/templates/index.html)

4. host the website, you can host on whatever you want. But I use [pythonanywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/) by follow the [tutorial video](https://youtu.be/v1PfNYOQ4Fk?t=480) on YouTube
